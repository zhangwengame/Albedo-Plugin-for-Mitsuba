 *
 * This integrator implements a basic path tracer and is a \emph{good default choice}
 * when there is no strong reason to prefer another method.
 *
 * To use the path tracer appropriately, it is instructive to know roughly how
 * it works: its main operation is to trace many light paths using \emph{random walks}
 * starting from the sensor. A single random walk is shown below, which entails
 * casting a ray associated with a pixel in the output image and searching for
 * the first visible intersection. A new direction is then chosen at the intersection,
 * and the ray-casting step repeats over and over again (until one of several
 * stopping criteria applies).
 * \begin{center}
 * \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{images/integrator_path_figure.pdf}
 * \end{center}
 * At every intersection, the path tracer tries to create a connection to
 * the light source in an attempt to find a \emph{complete} path along which
 * light can flow from the emitter to the sensor. This of course only works
 * when there is no occluding object between the intersection and the emitter.
 *
 * This directly translates into a category of scenes where
 * a path tracer can be expected to produce reasonable results: this is the case
 * when the emitters are easily ``accessible'' by the contents of the scene. For instance,
 * an interior scene that is lit by an area light will be considerably harder
 * to render when this area light is inside a glass enclosure (which
 * effectively counts as an occluder).
 *
 * Like the \pluginref{direct} plugin, the path tracer internally relies on multiple importance
 * sampling to combine BSDF and emitter samples. The main difference in comparison
 * to the former plugin is that it considers light paths of arbitrary length to compute
 * both direct and indirect illumination.
 *
 * For good results, combine the path tracer with one of the
 * low-discrepancy sample generators (i.e. \pluginref{ldsampler},
 * \pluginref{halton}, or \pluginref{sobol}).
 *
 * \paragraph{Strict normals:}\label{sec:strictnormals}
 * Triangle meshes often rely on interpolated shading normals
 * to suppress the inherently faceted appearance of the underlying geometry. These
 * ``fake'' normals are not without problems, however. They can lead to paradoxical
 * situations where a light ray impinges on an object from a direction that is classified as ``outside''
 * according to the shading normal, and ``inside'' according to the true geometric normal.
 *
 * The \code{strictNormals}
 * parameter specifies the intended behavior when such cases arise. The default (\code{false}, i.e. ``carry on'')
 * gives precedence to information given by the shading normal and considers such light paths to be valid.
 * This can theoretically cause light ``leaks'' through boundaries, but it is not much of a problem in practice.
 *
 * When set to \code{true}, the path tracer detects inconsistencies and ignores these paths. When objects
 * are poorly tesselated, this latter option may cause them to lose a significant amount of the incident
 * radiation (or, in other words, they will look dark).
 *
 * The bidirectional integrators in Mitsuba (\pluginref{bdpt}, \pluginref{pssmlt}, \pluginref{mlt} ...)
 * implicitly have \code{strictNormals} set to \code{true}. Hence, another use of this parameter
 * is to match renderings created by these methods.
 *
 * \remarks{
 *    \item This integrator does not handle participating media
 *    \item This integrator has poor convergence properties when rendering
 *    caustics and similar effects. In this case, \pluginref{bdpt} or
 *    one of the photon mappers may be preferable.
